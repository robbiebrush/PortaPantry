Name: PortaPantry

Description: PortaPantry is an inventory system, built to keep track of the
foods in your pantry. It allows you to input a food,
their food group, a common associated allergy, the amount, and the expiry date.
PortaPantry also allows you to edit or delete old entries,
and display your food group diversity as a pie chart.

Getting Started: On application start up, you will be provided with a credentials
screen to input your specific database settings. If valid, you will
be navigated to the home of PortaPantry, where you can see your foods.
You will also be able to navigate the tab menu to go add foods and view your food groups chart. Editing and deleting buttons are both at the bottom of Your Foods tab. At anytime, you can close PortaPantry with the exit button in the
menu bar.

Prerequisites: You will need an accessible Maria DB and Javafx 16 to use the program, as well as an internet connection.
